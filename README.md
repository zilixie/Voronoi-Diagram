# Visualization of the Fortune's Algorithm
A line sweeping algorithm for constructing Voronoi Diagram implemented in C++ combined with OpenGL. Visualizations are created for better understanding of how the algorithm works. My visualization includes:
- Visualization of the Tree structure used for presenting Beachline.
- Visualization of the parabolas & beachline.
- Visualization of the circle formed by circle events.
Some other events are presented with the help of plain text.
